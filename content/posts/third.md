_Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a cornerstone of modern software development. To truly grasp advanced principles like SOLID, it’s essential to start with a strong understanding of OOP fundamentals. This post will walk you through OOP concepts and then dive into the SOLID principles with simple examples to solidify your understanding._

## Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming revolves around the idea of representing real-world entities as objects. These objects encapsulate both data and behavior, making systems modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Let’s break down the core principles of OOP.

### 1. Encapsulation: Protecting Data

Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and behavior (methods) within a single class and restricting direct access to certain components.

#### Example

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Usage
account = BankAccount("Alice", 100)
account.deposit(50)
account.withdraw(30)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 120
```

### 2. Inheritance: Reusing Code

Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class, promoting code reuse.

#### Example

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, speed):
        self.brand = brand
        self.speed = speed

    def move(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} is moving at {self.speed} km/h")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def honk(self):
        print("Beep beep!")

# Usage
car = Car("Toyota", 100)
car.move()  # Output: The Toyota is moving at 100 km/h
car.honk()  # Output: Beep beep!
```

### 3. Polymorphism: Unified Interfaces

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

#### Example

```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Bark!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Meow!")

# Polymorphism in action
def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.make_sound()

animal_sound(Dog())  # Output: Bark!
animal_sound(Cat())  # Output: Meow!
```

### 4. Abstraction: Hiding Complexity

Abstraction focuses on exposing essential details while hiding the underlying complexity.

#### Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# Usage
shape = Rectangle(5, 10)
print(shape.calculate_area())  # Output: 50
```

### OOP Concepts in Real-World Scenarios

To help connect these principles, think of a software application like an e-commerce system:

- **Encapsulation**: Customer data (e.g., password) is protected and accessed only via secure methods.
- **Inheritance**: A "Product" class might serve as a base class for "Electronics" and "Clothing" subclasses.
- **Polymorphism**: A discount calculation can apply to various types of products in different ways but through a common interface.
- **Abstraction**: The user interacts with a "Place Order" button without needing to know the backend logic.

## Introducing the SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles build on OOP concepts to ensure that your code is robust, maintainable, and scalable. Let’s explore each principle with simple examples.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should perform only one responsibility.

#### Example

```python
class Report:
    def __init__(self, title, content):
        self.title = title
        self.content = content

class ReportFormatter:
    def format_as_pdf(self, report):
        # Logic to format as PDF
        pass

class ReportSaver:
    def save_to_file(self, report, filename):
        # Logic to save the report
        pass
```

Here, `Report`, `ReportFormatter`, and `ReportSaver` each have a single responsibility.

---

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Example

_Base Class:_

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        pass

```

_Subclasses:_

```python
class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing credit card payment of {amount}")

class PayPalProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing PayPal payment of {amount}")
```

Adding a new payment method doesn’t require modifying existing code—just create a new subclass.

---

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subclasses should be replaceable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.

#### Example

_Base Class:_

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        pass
```

_Subclasses:_

```python
class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def __init__(self, amount, card_number, cvv):
        self.amount = amount
        self.card_number = card_number
        self.cvv = cvv

    def validate_payment(self):
        print(f"Validating Credit Card: {self.card_number}")
        if len(self.card_number) == 16 and len(str(self.cvv)) == 3:
            print("Credit Card validated!")
            return True
        else:
            print("Credit Card validation failed!")
            return False

    def process_payment(self):
        if self.validate_payment():
            print(f"Processing Credit Card payment of ${self.amount}.")
        else:
            print("Credit Card payment failed!")


class PayPalProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def __init__(self, amount, email):
        self.amount = amount
        self.email = email

    def validate_payment(self):
        print(f"Validating PayPal email: {self.email}")
        if "@" in self.email:
            print("PayPal email validated!")
            return True
        else:
            print("PayPal validation failed!")
            return False

    def process_payment(self):
        if self.validate_payment():
            print(f"Processing PayPal payment of ${self.amount}.")
        else:
            print("PayPal payment failed!")

```

_Usage:_

```python
def process_transaction(payment):
    payment.process_payment()

# Valid subclasses
credit_card = CreditCardProcessor(100, "1234567890123456", 123)
paypal = PayPalProcessor(200, "user@example.com")
process_transaction(credit_card)
process_transaction(paypal)
```

**Violation**: The InvalidPaymentProcessor bypasses payment validation, thus violating the LSP:

```python
# Invalid subclass
class InvalidPaymentProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def process_payment(self):
        # No validation is done; this can violate LSP if the system expects validation
        print(f"Processing payment of ${self.amount} without validation.")

invalid_payment = InvalidPaymentProcessor(300)
process_transaction(invalid_payment)  # Violates LSP
```

**P.S.** Although the base class doesn’t explicitly require validation, the other subclasses imply that process_payment should involve legitimate checks. By skipping them entirely, InvalidPaymentProcessor breaks that assumption—hence, it cannot replace other payment processors without altering the program’s correctness.

**Why Bypass Validation Violates LSP**
Most parts of the system will assume that a valid payment is handled when process_payment completes. By not validating, InvalidPaymentProcessor contradicts this assumption. When substituted for a legitimate subclass, it changes the program’s expected behavior—thus violating LSP.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

#### Example

```python
class Workable:
    def work(self):
        pass

class Eatable:
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Human(Workable, Eatable):
    def work(self):
        print("Working")

    def eat(self):
        print("Eating")

class Robot(Workable):
    def work(self):
        print("Working")
```

Here, `Robot` doesn’t need the `eat` method, so we split the interfaces.

**Common Pitfall**
A single, massive interface (often called a "God interface") that forces all implementing classes to define methods they don’t need. Splitting into smaller interfaces prevents this bloat.

---

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

#### Example

_Base Class:_

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Developer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def develop(self):
        pass
```

_Low-Level Classes:_

```python
class BackendDeveloper(Developer):
    def develop(self):
        print("Writing backend code")

class FrontendDeveloper(Developer):
    def develop(self):
        print("Writing frontend code")
```

_High-Level Class:_

```python
class Project:
    def __init__(self, developers):
        self.developers = developers

    def develop(self):
        for dev in self.developers:
            dev.develop()

```

_Usage:_

```python
devs = [BackendDeveloper(), FrontendDeveloper()]
project = Project(devs)
project.develop()
```

**Practical Angle**
In a large application (e.g., a microservices setup), you might have multiple specialized services. By introducing abstractions (like interfaces for each service), your higher-level modules can be coded against these interfaces. If one service changes (or if you add a new type of developer), you only need to create/modify the low-level module—not all the high-level modules.
